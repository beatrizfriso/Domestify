Welcome to the **Domestify API**! This project is a simple yet powerful API built with .NET. It serves as a playground for me to practice and enhance my skills in both .NET development and DevOps practices.

## Overview

Domestify API is designed to help me learn and implement various aspects of software development and operations. While the current focus is on building a robust API using .NET, I plan to integrate several DevOps tools and practices into the project in the near future.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: A simple and clean RESTful API built with .NET.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub Actions.

## Future Integrations

I'm planning to integrate the following tools and practices to enhance the project's DevOps pipeline:

- **Security Scans**: Integration with OWASP ZAP for security scanning.
- **Code Quality**: Use of SonarCloud for code analysis and quality checks.
- **Notifications**: Setup for notifications via Slack and WhatsApp.
- **SonarCloud**: For static code analysis and ensuring code quality.
- **OWASP ZAP**: To conduct security scans and identify vulnerabilities.
- **Dependabot**: For automated dependency updates and security alerts.
- **Azure Deployment**: Automating deployments to Azure.
